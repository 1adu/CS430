# CS430
Marshall University CS 430 - CyberSecurity course HW assignments

## Cryptomatic
I think it was our first HW assignment. Not the hardest but definitely interesting one to do. 

## Password Cracking
This is where things get more challenging. I think I only got 19/20 from the easy file and 17/20 from the harder one. 

## Steganography
Honestly, one of the best HW assignments I have ever done at MU.
